I'm in Bratislava Slovakia and in\nthis video I'm going to teach you some\nEnglish vocabulary and phrases you can\nuse when you travel so if you like to\ntravel and you want to learn some new\nand useful words in English then watch\nuntil the end of this video I wanted to\narrive in Bratislava early in the day so\nI hit the road at 7 in the morning to\nhit the road means to start a journey or\ntrip usually by car the drive along the\nhighway was pretty Scenic when a\nlandscape is Scenic it means it's pretty\nit's beautiful and it's nice to look at\nI was excited to arrive in Bratislava\nand go\nsightseeing when you go sightseeing it\nmeans you explore a city and you see all\nthe attractions and sites I arrived in\nthe city at 9:00 a.m. and I figured the\nbest way to get around was by walking\nbradis laava is a very walkable city\nwhich means it's easy to walk through\nbut you could also use public\ntransportation public transportation is\nthings like buses trains or in this case\ntrams a tram is just a train that goes\non the road in the city I really enjoyed\nwandering through the Old Town and\nchecking out all the beautiful historic\nbuildings one of my favorite things\nabout brattis laava was definitely the\narchitecture at 11: I felt like a coffee\nso I decided to hang out at a cafe for a\nbit there was a large selection of\ncoffee and tea at this Cafe so I spent\nsome time browsing through the menu you\ncould say browsing but if you want to\nsound even more more natural you could\nsay I was flipping through the\nmenu after I finished my coffee I\ndecided to explore the castle now the\ncastle was on a hill so I had to walk up\na little bit and get some exercise to\nget into the castle I had to purchase a\nticket which cost me\n€14 in the castle there was a museum\nwhere I discovered more about the\nhistory of the city and of Slovakia in\nthe castle Museum I saw a lot of old\nartifacts an artifact is just an object\nfrom the past or from a long time ago\nthere was also an Art Exhibit which\ncontained a lot of paintings an exhibit\nis just a collection of something maybe\npaintings or artifacts in a museum\noutside of the castle I saw a place\nselling\nsouvenirs a souvenir is something you\ntake home from vacation like a fridge\nMagnet or maybe a postcard when I travel\nI don't normally buy souvenirs so I\ndidn't get anything today I was about to\nleave the castle and go back down into\nthe city when I realized I had\ncompletely missed the Castle Gardens so\nI went into the Castle Gardens to check\nthem out and to take a stroll to take a\nstroll means to take a slow relaxed walk\nthis is a great word and native speakers\nuse it all the time so I would\ndefinitely recommend adding it to your\nvocabulary the gardens were very\npeaceful and they were a great escape\nfrom The Busy bustling City the word\nbustling means very busy very noisy or\nvery loud if you're finding this lesson\nuseful then make sure to leave a like\nand let me know in the comments what you\nthink what words are new to you and what\nwords you already knew and if you want\nto improve your English with me this\nyear don't forget to subscribe to\nEnglish at the ready here on YouTube and\nto click the link in the description\nbelow to learn more about how I can help\nyou start speaking English fluently with\nthat said let's get back into the video\nand learn some more phrases and\nvocabulary after I took my stroll I was\ngetting hungry but first I needed to\ntake in the view to take something in\nmeans to admire it and in this case the\nview was breathtaking and I could see\nfar into the distance at this point I\nwas really hungry so I decided to grab a\nbite to eat to grab a bite to eat is a\nreally natural way of saying\nto go eat something I found a restaurant\nthat was highly rated which means it had\ngood reviews unfortunately I did not\nhave a\nreservation but thankfully they accepted\nWatkins which means I didn't need a\nreservation and I could easily get a\ntable I took a look at the menu and\ndecided to order my meal was delicious\nbut if you want to sound even more\nadvanced you can say it was\nexquisite\nexquisite after lunch I paid a visit to\nanother famous attraction called\nMichael's gate it's the only surviving\nCity Gate in Bratislava and it dates\nfrom the year 1300 since this gate is so\nold we could say it is historic it\nwasn't busy at all so I didn't have to\nline up and I could go in right away at\nfirst I thought it might be a tourist\ntrap which means it's not worth it or\nit's something just made for tourists\nbut after climbing a lot of stairs and\nseeing the view it was definitely worth\nit as we learned before I could also say\nthat I took in the view or that I\nadmired The View and since I could see\nthe whole city this was a\n360° view I could say it was a\npanorama a panorama is a view of a large\nlandscape or City from high above oh and\nof course the day wasn't complete\nwithout taking a detour to another\nbeautiful Cafe and enjoying a coffee\nthis was probably one of the most\nbeautiful cafes I've been to and it was\nquite small but it had a Charming\nAmbiance the Ambiance of a place is the\natmosphere or the vibe the word Vibe is\na bit more informal but it's still\nperfectly acceptable when you're talking\nto your friends or people you know well\nafter my second coffee of the day and a\npretty Tasty Cake I went back outside\nand I roamed around some more to roam\naround is a great word and it's a\nsynonym of to wander or to explore or\nwalk without having a real goal you're\nwalking around freely without any\npurpose and that's one of the things I\nlike most about traveling and exploring\nnew cities I had a great day because I\ncould travel at my own pace to travel at\nyour own pace means to have the freedom\nto travel as fast or as slow as you you\nwant and since I visited in October I\nwas lucky that it wasn't too crowded in\nthe city October is not peak season for\ntourism in Europe that means it's not\nthe busiest time of year all in all\nbradis laava is a pretty cool place and\nespecially if you're in Central Europe\nit's definitely worth a visit if you\nfound this video useful make sure to\nleave a like and let me know in the\ncomments comments and of course don't\nforget to subscribe to English
